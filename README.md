# Locality-Sensitive Hashing for reducing image datasets.

This project is part of an investigation into the reduction of redundant image databases. Its objective is to test the effectiveness of using random projections as a form of Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to decrease the size of image databases without losing test accuracy in recognition models.
